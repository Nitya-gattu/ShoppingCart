## Overview
SuperCart is designed to offer an efficient and user-friendly shopping experience on Android devices. The application supports functionalities like user authentication, product browsing, detailed product descriptions, cart management, and order placement, all implemented using modern development practices.

## Architecture
SuperCart is built using the MVVM architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting modularity and testability. The key components of the architecture include:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer, including local data managed by Room and remote data fetched via Retrofit.
- **View**: Represents the UI layer, consisting of activities and fragments responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Serves as a bridge between the Model and the View, holding UI-related data and handling business logic. Shared ViewModels facilitate data sharing between multiple fragments.

## Features
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifies navigation within the app and supports advanced navigation patterns.
- **Tab Layout and ViewPager**: Provides an intuitive tabbed navigation experience.
- **ScrollView**: Enables vertically scrollable content.
- **Shared ViewModel**: Facilitates data sharing between fragments, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
- **Room Database**: Efficiently manages local data storage with SQL-like queries.
- **Retrofit**: Handles network requests seamlessly, supporting RESTful API interactions.
- **Picasso**: Manages image loading and caching efficiently, reducing memory usage and improving performance.
- **Fragments**: Utilized for a modular and flexible UI design.
- **Menus and Dialogs**: Enhance user interactions and provide contextual options.
